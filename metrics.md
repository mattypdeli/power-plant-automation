# Success Metrics for Power Plant Sales Automation Project

This document outlines the key performance indicators (KPIs) for our system. The primary business goal is to reduce administrative burden and increase operational efficiency for the owner.

## Primary Metrics

* **Information Retrieval Time:** Reduce the time it takes to find a specific past bid, customer email, or part number from minutes/hours to **less than 5 seconds**.
* **Quote Generation Speed:** Decrease the time required from receiving a customer request to sending a formal quote by **at least 75%**.
* **Commission Calculation Time:** Reduce the time spent calculating sales commissions from several hours of manual spreadsheet work to an **automated, real-time calculation**.
* **Proactive Price Update Alerts:** Create a system that **automatically flags** when a new supplier price list arrives via email, preventing the use of outdated pricing in new bids.
